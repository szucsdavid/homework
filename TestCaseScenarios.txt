Test case scenarios for Trader.java

Scenario 1:
			Test a happy path where all the input data are valid and the TradeOrders are all over 1000$ and Cash balance doesn't go into negative.
Scenario 2:
			TradeOrders are all over 1000$ but the Cash balance theoretically could go into Negative (maybe due to rounding)
Scenario 3:
			Some of the TradeOrders are below the 1000$ threshold
Scenario 3b:
			Some of the TradeOrders are below the 1000$ threshold - Check if the weights are recalculated and the positions are rebalanced to get closer to the expedted weights - need to design test data for this scenario
Scenario 4:
			One or more Stock prices are set to 0
Scenario 5: 
			Expected Weights are less than 1.0
Scenario 6:
			Some stocks have low quantity in the current positions
Scenario 7:
			Test with invalid price type - int instead of double
Scenario 8:
			Test with invalid expedted weights type - int instead of double
Scenario 9:
			Test with invalid current position quantity - double instead of int
Scenario 10:
			Current position is an empty list
